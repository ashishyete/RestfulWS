Hi Bhagyashree,
Please find my Day to Day Work Activity in Fidelity.

Summary :
1. I am currently leading multiple projects and guide the team to consistently adhere to established engineering standards, best practices, and delivery commitments.

2. I serve as a trusted technical point of contact, with both my manager and team frequently seeking my input on technical decisions and application architecture design.

3. Through strong technical leadership and hands-on guidance, I have successfully driven programs from design through execution, ensuring timely and high-quality delivery.

4. I oversee application operations management in alignment with Fidelity architectural standards, proactively identifying issues, guiding the team on corrective actions, and stabilizing the application.

5. I provide clear project visibility to leadership by tracking application health metrics, preparing reports, and communicating insights to upper management for informed decision-making.

6. I am responsible for defining technical approaches, breaking down complex tasks, and creating execution plans that enable the team to deliver efficiently and confidently.

7. I will be leading a major application modernization initiative involving architectural design changes—an important and highly visible effort for senior leadership and enterprise architects.

8. In parallel with delivery responsibilities, I actively coach and mentor team members, supporting their technical growth as well as their professional and interpersonal skill development.

Thanks,

Ashish Yete
